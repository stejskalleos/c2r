%description
Setup Satellite yay!

# prep prepares the sources for building.
# This is where sources are unpacked and
# possible patches applied, and other similar activies could be performed.
# %prep

# The primary function of %setup is to set up the build directory
# for the package, typically unpacking the packageâ€™s
# sources but optionally it can just create the directory.
# %setup

# patch is used to apply patches on top of the just unpacked pristine sources.
# %patch

# In %build, the unpacked (and configured) sources are compiled to binaries.
%build

# install is where the compiled binaries are installed
# into the build root.
%install
